        A WaveNet was built on top of causal layers with windows size (kernel) = 2. The dilated rate will changed in order
        of the kernel size. The paper mentioned to use slice of 2 hence in this implementation we also use 2. In practice,
        it is not the matter to change kernel_size more than 2.

        The dilated rate will change for each layers in order of 2, for instance, ex: 1, 2, 2², 2³, ..
        If the number of dilated_layers is not defined, then the log(input, base 2) will be used.

        The activation of a wavenet block is done through gated unit activation which is tanh(x) * sigmoid(x). Here the
        multiplication is element-wise. There are also different improved version for this gated unit activation to
        improve convergence, ex, ReLu(x) * sigmoid(x).

        The final output of WavNet is a 1x1 convolution, output to another layers or a ReLu activation.
